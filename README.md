# GitHub-Powered Resume


## PURPOSE
- This README has two objectives:
    * This guide will offer step-by-step instructions for hosting and formatting a resume using Markdown, VS Code, GitHub, and Jekyll.  

    * In accordance with Andrew Etter's book, Modern Technical Writing, the practical steps outlined will be related to the general principles of current Technical Writing


## PREREQUISITES
- To begin with, we require a resume that is formatted in Markdown [Resume]()


## INSTRUCTIONS  

- I'll start with Eitter's basic procedure before going over the specific methods for formatting a resume and turning it into a static website with GitHub pages.

###  Etter's General Process

#### 1. Use LightWeight Markup  

 Markdown is the most extensively used light markup language because it has the cleanest syntax, a limited number of functionality, and no defined standards.   

 **The steps to format a resume using Markdown in VsCode are as follows :**  

 - Open Visual Studio Code.
 - Create a new file or open an existing with .md extension.
 - Create or edit your existing resume in Markdown. If you are new to Markdown please see the tutorial under [More Resources](#more-resources)
 - Download an extension _Markdown Preview Enhanced_ in Visual Studio Code.
 - Press `cmd-k v` or `ctrl-k v` to open preview to the side.


#### 2. Use Distributed Version Control

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a distributed version control system (DVCS), which will be used to host a resume.

**The Steps on how to host a resume on GitHub are as follows :**  

- In the upper left corner of home page of GitHub press `New` to create a repository.

- Name the repository as `username.github.io`.

- Choose the visibility as `public` for this repository.


   
#### 3. Make Static Websites
